The dataset consists of seven characteristics including five length measurements, fish species, weight, and numerical and categorical data. The dataset was produced by Aung Pyae and is available on the kaggle.com website. Given that there is a significant association between fish length and fish weight, the dataset is ideal for regression modelling. The "Weight" feature is utilised as the target feature in a linear regression analysis.
